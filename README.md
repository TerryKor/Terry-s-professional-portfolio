## Description

This is a Portfolio Web Page project that shows my recenlty learned skills at University of Toronto bootcamp.

I have created this project to help me to find future potential employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time web development positions.

My web page contains information about me, profile picture, how to contact me and projects I have been working on during bootcamp. Also, portfolio contains images of deployed web pages. Simply click on one of the top two images and you will be redirected to the deployed web pages. Moreover, two more images were added as a placeholder for my further projects.

Creating Portfolio I have used HTML5 and CSS in Visual Code. CSS code contains flexbox which helped me to position elements and make them flexible, media queries to make responsive desing which makes my web page looks good on all devices (desktops,laptops, ipads and mobile devices). The web page was uploaded and pushed to GitHub Repository named "challenge2".
